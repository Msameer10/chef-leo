# Chef Leo üç≥ ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)


**Chef Leo** is a web application that recommends recipes based on the ingredients you have at hand. Built as a learning project, it uses ReactJS for the frontend and integrates AI through a Hugging Face model to generate intelligent recipe suggestions.

## Features
- **Ingredient Input**: Add ingredients one at a time to build your list.
- **Recipe Suggestions**: Get personalized recipe recommendations after entering at least four ingredients.
- **Minimal Extra Ingredients**: Recipes are designed to minimize the use of additional ingredients.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Simple, clean, and intuitive interface.

## How It Works
1. Add ingredients using the input field.
2. Once you‚Äôve entered at least four ingredients, request a recipe.
3. Chef Leo will suggest a recipe that uses some or all of the provided ingredients, keeping extra ingredients to a minimum.

## Technologies Used
- **ReactJS**: For building the user interface.
